ISSUE CATEGORIES
================================================================================

Serverless Function Runtime Errors:           4 issues (33%)
Build/Deployment Configuration Failures:      5 issues (42%)
Monorepo & Workspace Management Issues:       2 issues (17%)
Edge Function Deployment Issues:              3 issues (25%)
Package Manager & Compatibility Issues:       2 issues (17%)
Performance/Infrastructure Issues:            2 issues (17%)

Note: Some issues span multiple categories

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS & PATTERNS
================================================================================

1. VERSION INCOMPATIBILITIES
   - Vercel CLI v32.3.0 and v33.3.0 introduced breaking changes
   - Node.js version mismatches between local and Vercel environment
   - Framework/library version incompatibilities (Next.js, React, Yarn)

2. MONOREPO COMPLEXITY
   - Workspace dependency resolution on first deployment
   - Turbo cache bypass issues
   - packageManager detection in multi-level structures

3. MODULE RESOLUTION
   - Import assertions breaking dependency scanners
   - PnP vs node_modules compatibility
   - Missing dependencies after build (scanner gaps)

4. ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENCES
   - Local builds succeed but Vercel deployments fail
   - Missing environment variables
   - Cache state differences between local and remote

5. INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS
   - Cold start delays inherent to Lambda
   - Deployment size limits (5GB)
   - Disk space constraints on free tier

================================================================================
SOLUTION EFFECTIVENESS BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Success Rate 0.90-0.97: 4 solutions (9%)  - Official fixes/updates
Success Rate 0.80-0.89: 8 solutions (18%) - Reliable workarounds
Success Rate 0.70-0.79: 12 solutions (27%) - Common workarounds
Success Rate 0.60-0.69: 15 solutions (34%) - Partial solutions
Success Rate <0.60:     5 solutions (11%)  - Experimental/unreliable

Most Effective: Upgrade CLI/dependencies (0.97-0.95)
Most Common: Environment variable configuration (0.70-0.80)
Least Effective: Performance workarounds like warming (0.58-0.65)
