Here is the checkpoint information extracted from the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Changed the "shared memory for AI" tagline to focus on "discover, fix, share" workflow instead of just listing content types
- Renamed "the shared memory loop" and added more context around collective learning

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- Tried fully replacing the existing "shared memory for AI" tagline, but the user wanted to keep some of the original wording

CURRENT_TASK:
- Updating the landing page content to better position hivemind as a foundational memory layer for AI agents, beyond just the fix-sharing use case

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Consider adding more visuals or animations to further illustrate the "shared memory" concept
2. Refine the messaging around how hivemind provides "collective wisdom" to empower AI agents
3. Explore ways to highlight the broader applications beyond just debugging/fixes
4. Get user feedback on the updated landing page content and iterate further

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The user is interested in positioning hivemind as a more comprehensive "memory layer" for AI, not just a fix-sharing tool
- Maintaining some of the original wording around "shared memory for AI" helps convey the foundational nature of the platform
