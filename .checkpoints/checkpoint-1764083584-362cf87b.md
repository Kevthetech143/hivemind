- None

CURRENT_TASK: 
- Implement in-band version notification system in MCP responses

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Add version checking against npm registry to the MCP client
2. Cache the version check for 1 hour to avoid excessive API calls
3. Add a "system_message" field to search responses to display version update information
4. Ensure the version update message is shown when a newer version is available

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
1. The user wants to reposition clauderepo as a "universal AI troubleshooting knowledge base" rather than just a "Claude-specific tool".
2. The branding, marketing, and positioning should reflect that clauderepo works with all major AI CLIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) and is not limited to Claude.
3. The user suggested framing clauderepo as a "second brain" or "focused brain attachment" for AI assistants, providing specialized domain expertise on demand.
