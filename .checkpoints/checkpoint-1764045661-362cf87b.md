Here is the checkpoint information extracted from the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Database migration (thumbs_up/thumbs_down columns) 
- Track endpoint v2 (solution_success/failure events)
- MCP v1.1.1 (trigger words + tracking calls)
- End-to-end testing (curl confirmed increments)

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- Supabase MCP apply_migration (read-only mode)
- psql direct (not installed) 
- Supabase db push without proper migration dir
- v1.1.0 published without tracking calls

CURRENT_TASK:
- Contribution of 2 new solutions to the clauderepo knowledge base:
  1. Supabase read-only transaction workaround
  2. PostgreSQL function return type fix

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Monitor production thumbs data (first 10 users)
2. Test trigger words in production  
3. Update search ranking with thumbs data
4. Add Wilson Score confidence intervals
5. Display community ratings in results

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- Supabase MCP is read-only by design, need to use psql directly for migrations
- Database password required to execute migrations on Supabase
- Need to DROP function before recreating to fix return type conflicts
- Installed libpq client tools on macOS to enable direct psql access
