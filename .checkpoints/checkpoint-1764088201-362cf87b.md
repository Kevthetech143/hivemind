Checkpoint information extracted from the session transcript:

1. VERIFIED_WORKING: None (no features/implementations confirmed working yet)

2. FAILED_APPROACHES: 
   - Displaying fake "95% success rate" and "200 users" claims (these are from imported Stack Overflow data, not real community votes)

3. CURRENT_TASK: 
   - Addressing the issue of displaying misleading confidence metrics for imported content

4. NEXT_ACTIONS:
   - Remove success rates entirely until real votes come in
   - Show "unverified" badge for solutions without real votes
   - Change display from "95% success" to "Stack Overflow: 200 votes" to be honest about the data source
   - Ensure clauderepo content is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 to comply with Stack Overflow's licensing

5. SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
   - The knowledge base contains 2,535 total solutions, but only 49 (2%) have actual user votes
   - All "success rate" metrics are pre-filled from imported Stack Overflow data, not real clauderepo community feedback
   - The total "thumbs up" count of 14,932 is also imported from Stack Overflow, not generated within clauderepo

The key insight is that the current confidence metrics are entirely fabricated and misleading, so they need to be removed or significantly changed before launch.
