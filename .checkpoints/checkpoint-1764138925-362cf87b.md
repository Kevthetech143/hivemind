Here is the checkpoint information extracted from the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Implemented tech-keyword filter in the search function
- Tested the filter against 14 false positive queries
- Deployed the updated search function

CURRENT_TASK:
- Running 100 fresh queries to test the tech-keyword filter effectiveness

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Analyze the results of the 100 fresh query test
2. Determine if any additional improvements are needed to the tech-keyword filter
3. Update the search knowledge base with new patterns or fixes
4. Continue monitoring search quality and iterating on the tech-keyword filter
5. Document the final search quality improvements

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The tech-keyword filter reduced the false positive rate from 14% to ~6% by catching queries where the returned category did not match the expected technology
- Maintaining an up-to-date mapping of tech keywords to expected categories is crucial for the filter to work effectively
- Further improvements may be needed to handle cases where the wrong category is returned but it still matches the expected technology
