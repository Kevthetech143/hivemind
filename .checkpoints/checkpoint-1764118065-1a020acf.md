1. VERIFIED_WORKING:
   - Extracted SQL INSERT statements for 8-10 common Kubernetes StatefulSet debugging errors
   - Extracted SQL INSERT statements for 10-12 common Kubernetes service debugging errors
   - Extracted SQL INSERT statements for 8-10 common Kubernetes Init Container debugging errors

2. FAILED_APPROACHES: 
   - No failed approaches reported in the session transcript.

3. CURRENT_TASK:
   - Mining Batch 3: Kubernetes debug guides (4 URLs)

4. NEXT_ACTIONS:
   - Complete mining Batch 3: Kubernetes debug guides
   - Move on to Batch 4: Next.js + npm errors (7 URLs)
   - Review and organize all extracted SQL statements into a single coherent knowledge base

5. SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
   - The session uncovered a comprehensive set of common Kubernetes debugging errors and solutions across StatefulSets, services, and init containers.
   - The SQL INSERT statement format proved to be an effective way to systematically capture and structure the debugging knowledge.
   - Maintaining a structured todo list and progressing through batches of URLs helped organize the knowledge mining process.
