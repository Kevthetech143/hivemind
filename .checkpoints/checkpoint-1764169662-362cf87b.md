SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
1. The system has a robust audit trail, with contributions coming from various sources (tickets, anonymous, admin).
2. There is an opportunity to improve the ticket management process to avoid creating duplicate tickets.
3. Distinguishing admin vs. user contributions is currently not implemented, but could be added to provide better visibility and control.
