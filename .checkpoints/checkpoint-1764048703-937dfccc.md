1. VERIFIED_WORKING:
   - Replaced Unicode arrow characters (→) with ASCII equivalents (->) in SQL migration file
   - Used double single quotes ('') to escape quotes in PostgreSQL string literals instead of backslash

2. FAILED_APPROACHES:
   - Complex sed commands with multiple backslashes caused syntax errors when applying the migration
   - Attempting to use Supabase CLI commands like `supabase db push` resulted in errors

3. CURRENT_TASK:
   - Applying the updated batch 4 community contributions migration to the remote database

4. NEXT_ACTIONS:
   - Simplify the SQL migration file by removing complex escape sequences
   - Try applying the migration again using a more straightforward approach
   - Verify the migration applies successfully and all entries are added to the database
   - Review the results to ensure no further issues

5. SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
   - Proper escaping of quotes and avoiding Unicode characters are crucial for successful PostgreSQL migrations
   - Complex shell commands can introduce additional issues that are better addressed through simpler, direct SQL updates
