## 🤖 AI-ANALYZED SESSION

This checkpoint was generated by analyzing the session transcript with Claude Haiku.
The AI extracted verified features, failures, and next actions from the conversation.

**Quality:** ~90% (AI semantic analysis)
**Cost:** ~$0.03 per checkpoint
**Automation:** Fully automatic

Here is the summary based on the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Haiku agents are performing as well as Sonnet agents for mining data from official sources (e.g. migration guides, documentation)
- Haiku maintains high quality (92-98% effectiveness) at a significantly lower cost (1/20th the price) compared to Sonnet

FAILED_APPROACHES: 
No failed approaches mentioned in the transcript.

CURRENT_TASK:
Continuing to mine additional data from official sources using 20 Haiku agents.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Mine more CVEs from official sources (e.g. Python, Ruby, Java/Spring, Rust crates, Go modules)
2. Extract postmortems from additional cloud providers (Azure, Netlify, Heroku, DigitalOcean, MongoDB Atlas, Datadog, PagerDuty)
3. Document errors/issues from more official framework/library documentation (Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask, Laravel, Spring Boot, Symfony)
4. Cover database migration guides (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
5. Extract errors/issues from additional build tools (Turbopack, esbuild, Rollup, Parcel), testing frameworks (Vitest, Cypress, Testing Library), and package managers (pnpm, yarn, Cargo)

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- For structured data extraction from official sources, Haiku agents can match the quality of Sonnet agents at a significantly lower cost.
- The user has confirmed that Haiku's performance is on par with Sonnet's for this specific task of mining official documentation.
