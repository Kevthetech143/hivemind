Here is the summary of the checkpoint information extracted from the provided session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Migrated ESLint solutions related to TypeScript resolution, configuration, and plugin usage.
- Edited the migration file to simplify the command for configuring the eslint-import-resolver-typescript package.

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- The migration file for adding ESLint solutions related to the "no-console" rule encountered an error when trying to apply it, due to an invalid JSON input syntax.

CURRENT_TASK:
- Applying the remaining migrations, skipping the problematic ESLint "no-console" batch for now.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Finish applying the remaining migrations without the ESLint "no-console" batch.
2. Investigate the cause of the JSON parsing error in the ESLint "no-console" migration and resolve it.
3. Ensure all migrations are successfully applied.
4. Test the functionality of the ESLint configuration changes.
5. Determine if the skipped ESLint "no-console" migration is still needed or can be safely omitted.

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The migration file for ESLint solutions related to TypeScript had an issue with the command syntax for the "Extend ESLint config with plugin:import/typescript preset" solution, which was simplified during the session.
- There is an error with the ESLint "no-console" migration that needs further investigation.
