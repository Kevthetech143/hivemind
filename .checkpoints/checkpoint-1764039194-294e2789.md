Here is the summary of the session:

1. VERIFIED_WORKING:
   - Successfully mined security advisories, CVEs, and incident postmortems for various cloud platforms and software ecosystems.
   - Created SQL migrations to store the mined data in a structured format.
   - Adapted the DOC_MINING_PROMPT.md format for postmortems, handling the different structure compared to error documentation.

2. FAILED_APPROACHES:
   - No failed approaches noted in the transcript. The mining tasks were completed successfully.

3. CURRENT_TASK:
   - The user has requested to launch 20 agents in parallel to mine a comprehensive set of postmortems and security advisories.

4. NEXT_ACTIONS:
   1. Launch the 20 agents to mine the following data sources:
      - AWS outage postmortems
      - GitHub incident reports
      - Cloudflare postmortems
      - Google Cloud incidents
      - Azure outage reports
      - Stripe incident reports
      - Vercel status page incidents
      - MongoDB Atlas incidents
      - Redis Labs incidents
      - Major CVEs/security advisories
      - Kubernetes incidents
      - Docker Hub outages
      - npm registry incidents
      - PyPI incidents
      - Atlassian (Jira/Confluence) outages
      - Datadog incidents
      - PagerDuty incidents
      - Netlify incidents
      - Heroku incidents
      - GitLab incidents
   2. Adapt the DOC_MINING_PROMPT.md format for the postmortems, following the structure: incident → root cause → mitigation → prevention.
   3. Ensure the mined data is stored in the appropriate Supabase migrations.
   4. Verify the completeness and quality of the mined data.
   5. Prepare the mined data for integration into the documentation system.

5. SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
   - The user confirmed that mining postmortems and security advisories would be valuable, as they contain real-world battle-tested solutions beyond what is typically found in official documentation.
   - The assistant identified different data source types (highly structured, semi-structured, unstructured) and the corresponding extraction patterns required for each.
   - The user requested a comprehensive mining effort across 20 data sources, demonstrating the need for a scalable and adaptable documentation mining system.
