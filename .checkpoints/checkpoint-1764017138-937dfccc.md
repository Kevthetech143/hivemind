VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Published v0.2.120 fixes issues with Claude Code not opening after update to v0.2.119
- Windows CLI freeze resolved as of version 1.0.98

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- Workaround for VS Code extension failing after Windows password change did not have confirmed successful outcome
- Permission issue workaround of launching with --dangerously-skip-permissions was not considered a great solution

CURRENT_TASK: 
Removing unconfirmed solutions from the knowledge base to improve overall quality.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Delete entries #121 (VS Code password change) and #124 (CLAUDE.md violations) from the knowledge base.
2. Confirm the remaining 3 solutions have strong maintainer or user verification.
3. Investigate top open issues and prioritize adding new verified solutions.
4. Implement more robust vetting process for future knowledge base updates.
5. Review monitoring and alerting to detect quality regressions early.

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- Our current vetting process was not strict enough, allowing some unconfirmed solutions to be added.
- We need a more systematic way to verify solutions, focusing on maintainer acknowledgements and multiple user confirmations.
