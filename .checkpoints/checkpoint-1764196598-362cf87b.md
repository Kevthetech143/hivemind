**Quality:** ~90% (AI semantic analysis)
**Cost:** ~$0.03 per checkpoint
**Automation:** Fully automatic

---

1. VERIFIED_WORKING:
   - Dual agent mode activated and running with separate Alpha and Beta terminals
   - Cleanup script (/tmp/cleanup-dual-claude.sh) successfully stops processes and kills tmux sessions

2. FAILED_APPROACHES:
   - Alpha and Beta agents did not have access to MCP tools, likely due to permissions issues.

3. CURRENT_TASK:
   - None at the moment, session focused on setting up and cleaning up dual agent mode.

4. NEXT_ACTIONS:
   - Investigate why Alpha and Beta agents cannot access MCP tools and resolve any permission issues
   - Consider adding a reminder or hook in the codebase to enforce checking CLAUDE.md before taking action on errors

5. SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
   - The dual agent setup provides a powerful collaboration workflow, with agents communicating via HTTP and file watchers
   - Proper cleanup and shutdown of the dual agent system is important to avoid leaving behind orphaned processes
   - Potential need for better enforcement of documentation/guidelines to prevent ad-hoc problem solving
