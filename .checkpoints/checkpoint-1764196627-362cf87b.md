## 🤖 AI-ANALYZED SESSION

This checkpoint was generated by analyzing the session transcript with Claude Haiku.
The AI extracted verified features, failures, and next actions from the conversation.

**Quality:** ~90% (AI semantic analysis)
**Cost:** ~$0.03 per checkpoint
**Automation:** Fully automatic

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- The "Dual Agent Spawn" skill was successfully activated, launching two separate Claude agent sessions (ALPHA and BETA) in separate terminal windows.
- The two agents can communicate with each other via the `/tmp/send-to-alpha.sh` and `/tmp/send-to-beta.sh` scripts.
- The dual agent system includes HTTP servers, fetchers, and watchers to automate the communication between the two agents.

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- The two spawned agents did not have access to the MCP tools, likely due to permissions issues. The skill does not directly address this problem.

CURRENT_TASK:
- Exploring the capabilities and potential use cases of the dual agent system.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Investigate the permissions and configuration required for the MCP tools to work within the spawned agent sessions.
2. Identify potential collaborative tasks the two agents could work on, such as problem-solving, research, or content generation.
3. Review the dual agent architecture and troubleshooting documentation to understand the system in more depth.
4. Consider ways to enhance the dual agent system, such as adding monitoring, logging, or more advanced communication protocols.
5. Evaluate the performance and scalability of the dual agent approach for potential real-world applications.

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The dual agent system provides a flexible framework for spawning and coordinating independent Claude agents, opening up new possibilities for collaborative work and task delegation.
- The attention to critical fixes, such as the fetcher logic and tmux automation, suggests the system has been refined and improved over time.
- The dual agent approach could potentially be extended to support more than two agents, enabling more complex multi-agent workflows and interactions.
