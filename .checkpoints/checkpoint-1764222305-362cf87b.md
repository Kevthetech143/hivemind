CURRENT_TASK: 
- Update the MCP client to pass `pending_id` when available, and track the last `pending_id` from `resolve_ticket`.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Implement `pending_id` tracking in the MCP client.
2. Test the updated `report_solution_outcome` tool with `pending_id`.
3. Monitor solution feedback and approval flows to ensure they're working as expected.
4. Document the `pending_id` handling in the project README or relevant documentation.
5. Consider adding any additional validation or error handling around `pending_id` usage.

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The Supabase track function has been updated to support `pending_id` for approving pending solutions when a `solution_success` event is received.
