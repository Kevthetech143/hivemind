## 🤖 AI-ANALYZED SESSION

This checkpoint was generated by analyzing the session transcript with Claude Haiku.
The AI extracted verified features, failures, and next actions from the conversation.

**Quality:** ~90% (AI semantic analysis)
**Cost:** ~$0.03 per checkpoint
**Automation:** Fully automatic

Here is the extracted information from the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- The search function is calling `search_knowledge` without passing an embedding parameter, which triggers the trigram fallback when FTS doesn't match.

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- None mentioned in the transcript.

CURRENT_TASK:
- Checking what the `search_knowledge` function returns when no embedding is passed and there's no FTS match.

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Investigate the behavior of the `search_knowledge` function when no embedding is provided and there's no FTS match.
2. Determine if the trigram fallback is working as expected in this scenario.
3. Identify any potential issues or edge cases in the search functionality.
4. Recommend improvements or optimizations to the search implementation.
5. Verify the search functionality with the user to ensure it meets their requirements.

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The search function is calling `search_knowledge` without passing an embedding parameter, which triggers the trigram fallback when FTS doesn't match.
- The transcript indicates that the search functionality is working, but there may be room for improvement or optimization.
