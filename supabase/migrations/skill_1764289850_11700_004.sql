      "solution": "Step 1: Design Philosophy Creation - Establish aesthetic movement manifesto",
      "manual": "Create a visual philosophy (not layouts or templates) as an aesthetic movement manifesto. (1) Name the movement (1-2 words): ''Brutalist Joy'', ''Chromatic Silence'', ''Metabolist Dreams''. (2) Articulate in 4-6 concise paragraphs expressing how philosophy manifests through: space and form, color and material, scale and rhythm, composition and balance, visual hierarchy. CRITICAL GUIDELINES: (A) Avoid redundancy - mention each design aspect once. (B) Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY with phrases like ''meticulously crafted'', ''deep expertise'', ''painstaking attention'', ''master-level execution''. (C) Leave creative space - be specific about aesthetic direction but concise enough for next phase interpretation. (D) Guide visual expression NOT text - information lives in design. ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES: visual philosophy as aesthetic worldview, minimal text as visual-only element, spatial expression through form/color/composition, artistic freedom with creative room, pure design art objects, expert craftsmanship emphasis. Output as .md file with 4-6 substantial paragraphs. Keep generic without mentioning final intention - adaptable anywhere",
      "note": "Philosophy is the foundation for visual expression. Stress multiple times that final work must appear meticulously crafted by someone at absolute top of field, labored over with countless hours of care. This framing is essential for next phase excellence"

      "solution": "Step 2: Deduce Subtle Conceptual Reference - Identify niche essence thread",
      "manual": "CRITICAL: Before canvas creation, identify the subtle conceptual thread from request. The topic is a SUBTLE, NICHE REFERENCE embedded within art itself - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar should feel it intuitively, while others experience masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides soul - quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, composition. ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE: Reference must be refined to enhance work''s depth without announcing itself. Think like jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know catch it, but everyone appreciates the music. Refine reference so it''s sophisticated, not obvious. This invisible conceptual core elevates the work from decoration to art",
      "note": "The reference is the ''DNA'' of the piece - woven invisibly. Balance between being discoverable for those in the know and appearing as pure aesthetic masterpiece to general viewer. Never make the reference literal or obvious"

      "manual": "With philosophy and conceptual framework established, express on canvas as museum/magazine quality work. Use design philosophy as scientific bible foundation, borrowing visual language of systematic observation - dense marks, repeated elements, layered patterns building meaning through patient repetition and sustained viewing reward. Treat abstract philosophical design as if scientific documentation. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers suggesting imaginary discipline, treating invisible subject with reverence typically reserved for observable phenomena. Anchor with subtle phrases/details, limited intentional color palette. Use analytical visual language to express human experience ideas - result feels like artifact proving ephemeral can be studied and understood. CRITICAL: (1) TEXT as contextual element - minimal, visual-first, context-guided (punk poster vs minimalist ceramic). Font usually thin. All fonts design-forward, prioritizing visual communication. NOTHING overlaps, NOTHING falls off page. Proper margins, breathing room, clear separation for professional execution NON-NEGOTIABLE. (2) FONTS: Search ./canvas-fonts directory. Make typography part of art itself - if abstract, bring font onto canvas, not digital typeset. (3) CRAFTSMANSHIP: Create appearing like countless hours labored by top-field expert. Composition, spacing, color, typography must scream expert-level. Double-check nothing overlaps, formatting flawless, every detail perfect. Museum-display worthy. (4) OUTPUT: Single downloadable .pdf or .png file with design philosophy .md file alongside",
      "note": "This is TRUE ART not decoration. Push aesthetics to frontier while using philosophy as guiding principle. Embrace design freedom and choice. Every detail must demonstrate expert craftsmanship and painstaking attention. No filters, no cartoony approaches - always sophisticated museum/magazine quality"

    {
      "solution": "Step 4: Refinement and Polish - Achieve pristine masterpiece craftsmanship",
      "manual": "CRITICAL: User expectation - ''It must be pristine, a masterpiece of craftsmanship, as if displayed in museum.'' To refine: AVOID ADDING MORE GRAPHICS. Instead refine what exists and make extremely crisp, respecting design philosophy and minimalism principles entirely. Rather than new functions/shapes, ask: ''How can I make what''s already here more of a piece of art?'' Take second pass. Go back and refine/polish further for philosophical masterpiece. Focus on: (1) Composition cohesion, (2) Crispness and clarity, (3) Respect for minimalism, (4) Expert-level detail, (5) Visual harmony. Every element must feel intentional. Nothing arbitrary. Result must feel like it took countless hours by someone at absolute pinnacle of design expertise. This is the difference between good design and museum-quality art",
      "note": "Refinement is about elevation, not expansion. Make existing elements perfect rather than adding more. Focus on making composition more cohesive, elegant, and artistically refined. Every alignment, every color choice, every detail must be considered and intentional"
    },
    {
      "solution": "Step 5: Multi-Page Option - Create cohesive visual narrative",
      "manual": "For multi-page works: Create additional pages as creative variations on design philosophy but distinctly different. Bundle in same .pdf or multiple .pngs. Treat first page as single page in coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make next pages unique twists and memories of original. Have them almost tell story in tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom. Each page maintains design philosophy foundation while exploring different visual expressions. Pages should feel related but distinct - like chapters in visual narrative. Maintain consistent aesthetic direction and craftsmanship standards across all pages",
      "note": "Multi-page work becomes a visual narrative or meditation. Each page unique expression of core philosophy. Together they tell subtle story without literal explanation. Maintain museum-quality standards across all pages"

  'Adding too much graphic elements instead of refining existing ones - refinement is about elevation not expansion. Using text heavily instead of letting design communicate - text must be minimal and serve visual composition. Making reference obvious instead of subtle - should be intuitive only for those familiar. Creating cartoony or amateur work - must maintain sophisticated museum-quality standards. Fonts that don''t serve design - every typographic choice must be design-forward. Elements overlapping or falling off page - professional execution requires perfect spacing and containment. Not emphasizing craftsmanship appearance - work must look like painstakingly crafted by expert, not AI-generated',

Canvas created as museum/magazine quality visual art (PDF or PNG). Typography is design-forward and integral to composition. NO overlapping elements, NO margins violations, professional containment. Appearance of countless hours expert craftsmanship. Refinement pass completed focusing on crispness and cohesion. Multi-page works (if applicable) maintain consistent philosophy across pages with unique visual variations. Final output downloadable and portfolio-worthy',
