Checkpoint Information:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Feedback system now uses numeric solution_id instead of query text matching
- v2.1.1 of MCP client deployed successfully, "clauderepo: worked" feedback is now reliable

FAILED_APPROACHES:
None mentioned

CURRENT_TASK:
- Building validation system for ticket solutions before adding them to the main knowledge base

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Create `pending_ticket_solutions` table to hold unverified solutions from tickets
2. Add `verified` flag to `knowledge_entries` table and show "unverified" indicator in search results
3. Implement `admin_approve_solution(solution_id)` function to fast-track verified solutions
4. Add `confirm_step(ticket_id, step_number, result)` tool for guided troubleshooting
5. Deploy and test the full validation flow

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The current flow of automatically adding ticket solutions to the knowledge base is dangerous, as it can propagate untested or incomplete fixes
- Implementing a validation system with a separate queue for pending solutions, required user confirmation, and optional admin approval is necessary to ensure quality of the knowledge base

## 🔄 RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS

After this checkpoint loads in the new session:

1. **Review AI-extracted context** - Haiku analyzed the full transcript
2. **Verify critical details** - AI may miss nuances, confirm with user
3. **Continue from next actions** - Priority-ordered by AI analysis
4. **Update user on status** - Explain what was preserved
