Here is the checkpoint information extracted from the session transcript:

VERIFIED_WORKING:
- Added a "type" column to the knowledge_entries table to distinguish between "flow" and "fix" entries
- Updated the search Edge Function to detect the entry type and render fixes vs flows differently

FAILED_APPROACHES:
- No failed approaches mentioned

CURRENT_TASK:
- Update the MCP client to render fixes vs flows differently based on the detected entry type

NEXT_ACTIONS:
1. Deploy the updated search Edge Function to Supabase
2. Update the MCP client code to handle the different rendering for fixes vs flows
3. Create and insert a test "flow" entry for the "respawn claude" use case
4. Test that the search returns the flow entry correctly when searching for "how to respawn"
5. Report back on the outcome of the test flow entry

SESSION_DISCOVERIES:
- The database schema and search query have been updated to support differentiating between fix and flow entries
- This will enable a better user experience in the MCP client by rendering the solutions in a more appropriate format
